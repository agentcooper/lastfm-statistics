## Last.fm monthly playcount chart

http://agentcooper.github.com/lastfm-statistics/

All API methods I wrote for this app are in [```lastfm.js```](https://github.com/agentcooper/lastfm-statistics/blob/gh-pages/lastfm.js) and it also can be used as a node.js module, but install dependencies first with ```npm install -d```. Feel free to use them.
